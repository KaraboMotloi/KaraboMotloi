- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KaraboMotloi
- I'm a data and design enthusiast with experience in building intuitive, data-driven solutions. On GitHub, Iâ€™ve worked on projects ranging from Power BI dashboards and Python scripts to system design documentation and integration workflows. My work reflects a strong interest in turning complex data into simple, meaningful insights and designing user-friendly systems that solve real problems. Whether it's data visualization, process automation, or API integration, I enjoy collaborating on projects that merge technical skill with thoughtful design.
